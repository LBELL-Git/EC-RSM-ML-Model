# Modelling electrical conduction in resistive-switching-memory through machine learning

The motivation of the project is to model the electrical conduction of resistive switching memories using machine learning algorithms. Here, we used multi-layer perceptron, random forest machine learning algorithms to model the electrical conduction of aluminum nitride RSM devices.

The data to model the electrical conduction of resistive switching memories are measured using the standard measurement instruments. The processed and collected date amounts to approximately 3100 data points. 

We used standard machine learning python libraries and Jupiter notebooks to train the model. The trained models are places in so and so directories. The folder consists of have the python code used to develop the models. Also, the code supports testing the previously trained models which are already present in “directories”. 

While we execute the Jupiter notebooks, the results and figures are displayed in the notebook console. Figures that are in the “folder” and in the paper are generated using the saved model upon inference.
